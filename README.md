Flower.ipynb-
This project is a CNN for flower classification. It preprocesses image data, constructs a CNN architecture, trains it on a flower image dataset, and evaluates its performance. The CNN distinguishes between different flower types like Lily, Lotus, Sunflower, Orchid, and Tulip.

Waste Management.ipynb - 
This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to create a CNN for waste classification. It preprocesses image data, builds the CNN, trains it on a dataset, and predicts whether waste is recyclable or non-recyclable.

Mnist.ipynb - 
This project presents a thorough exploration of the MNIST dataset, encompassing data loading, preprocessing (scaling and normalization), classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, and insightful evaluation through visualization of performance metrics like confusion matrices.
