Flower.ipynb-
This project is a CNN for flower classification. It preprocesses image data, constructs a CNN architecture, trains it on a flower image dataset, and evaluates its performance. The CNN distinguishes between different flower types like Lily, Lotus, Sunflower, Orchid, and Tulip.

Waste Management.ipynb - 
This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to create a CNN for waste classification. It preprocesses image data, builds the CNN, trains it on a dataset, and predicts whether waste is recyclable or non-recyclable.

Mnist.ipynb - 
This project presents a thorough exploration of the MNIST dataset, encompassing data loading, preprocessing (scaling and normalization), classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, and insightful evaluation through visualization of performance metrics like confusion matrices.

Msc.ipynb - 
This project implements an ensemble NLP model for classifying medical transcriptions by specialty, achieving 83% accuracy. Using BERT, CNN, and LSTM as base models, the ensemble leverages their distinct strengthsâ€”BERT for contextual understanding, CNN for local feature extraction, and LSTM for sequential dependencies. The outputs from each base model are then combined in a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) stacking model to make final predictions. This approach enhances classification performance, optimizing precision, recall, and F1 scores across various medical specialties, making it a robust solution for medical text classification.

bot.py - 
This project develops a Streamlit application that integrates OpenAI's language models with an SQLite database to facilitate interaction with uploaded PDF documents. Upon uploading a PDF, the application extracts the text and generates embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model. These embeddings are stored in a SQLite database, allowing for efficient retrieval and similarity search. Users can input queries to find the most relevant document based on the stored embeddings, with responses generated by a question-answering chain. The app also maintains conversation history for a seamless user experience, enabling users to track interactions and clear the history as needed. This design offers an effective solution for extracting insights from stored text documents, leveraging the capabilities of NLP for enhanced user interaction.
